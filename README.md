# eNeg StrategyApp

## Description

StrategyApp is based on the different categories of negotiation strategies. The user defines his negotiation strategy, e.g. hardliner strategy or solution-oriented strategy and the App notifies, if the user doesn't act according the defined strategy. Also the StrategyApp suggest certain actions based on the course of the negotiation/offers exchange. There are two kind of time-based negotiation strategies implemented:

* Conceder Strategies: in the beginning of the negotiation there is a lot of flexibility and reaching the end of the negotiation, the flexibility is getting less.
* Boulware Strategies: in the beginning of the negotiation there is a position of nearly no flexibility and reaching the end of the negotiation, the flexibility is getting more and the position is solution-oriented to find an agreement

StrategyApp is a silverlight web based platform with desktop add-on extension, MVVM framework applied with n-tier layers.

## Features

* StrategyApp as already can be recognised by the name, supports the user to define his strategy or intentions during a negotiation. The App will advise the user through the course of the negotiation depending on the certian period and stage of the negotiation.
* Display the current status of the negotitation and check whether the negotiation position of the user and his offers/conversations with the counterparts follow his chosen strategy or not.
* Strategy status represented in red, yellow and green lights to be more eye catching
* Strategy App provides certain advice messages for the user to help him in finalizing negotiation steps and to enhance the negotation procedure.
* Strategy app is also used as an input factor for the [OfferApp](https://github.com/ivconsult/eNeg-OfferApp)
